...also known as foo-dogsquared's `personal-lectures`

A repo containing a collection of my study notes about various stuff whether
be programming, mathematics, electronics, engineering, and anything that is
worth detailing over.

Think of this repo as an open-sourced online
http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/[Feynman notebook] 
of someone... or something.

This open study notebook uses LaTeX as the files to be used for my notes so you'll have to install a LaTeX distribution to be able to compile it and view the results. 
I might consider using a CI server to automate that (perhaps) for my (and everyone else's) convenience.

== Some other things

I'll link you to http://freebies-hunt.netlify.com/[Freebies Hunt]. It's a website 
that is full of free and open content that ranges from books, software, courses, 
and so much more. It's also where I list most of my resources use to study since 
I try to study deeply as much as possible with only free resources (though, admittedly 
it doesn't really bear useful results; just go and start right away with any kind).

Speaking of resource list, here's one of the most (if not, the most)
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome[awesome] resource list. It's a resource list... 
of resource list. "RESOURCE LIST"-CEPTION!

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

=== What?

Yeah... I have that in mind too...

=== How?

I take notes... but seriously, most of these notes came from my offline notebook, also known as paper notebook. 
Although, some of them are re-edited just to go for another attempt at explaining it.

=== Why?

For open knowledge, only without the guarantee of precision and
accuracy... üôÉ And to practice this kind of
writing-everything-that-you've-learned-down-in-a-notebook-on-a-reformatted-way
practice.

=== How to contribute?

It's a collection of my notes about anything
and it is mostly intended for personal use. So...

If you want to correct me on things, just shoot me an email or create a
new issue on the issue tracker. üòÅ

If you want, feel free to improve it (esp. the CLI program). It's here so why 
not go for it, too.
